# What is?
This is a piece of coursework I made which totally oversteps what we were meant to do and will hopefully gain me more marks.

# Why node?
Because I'm most comfortable with node. No, you should not deploy this, it will not work. (Well it might, but it's still a super bad idea)

# How install?
Clone repo, then run "npm install" in the directory of whichever bit you want. "cnc" is the C&C server, "bot" is the bot that goes on the 'infected' machine, and "posttest" is just a test post I was messing with so I didn't have to boot up the bot every time.
